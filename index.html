        <h2> Where I come from... </h2>
        <p> I am from Martinique, I was born here and I have lived there ever since. Therefore I have a strong cultural bond with west indies. It has been a bit difficult to move house but the diversity in the Caribbean has made me open-minded. </p>

        <img src="F12.jpg" height="280" width="180" alt="Formula 1">
    	<p class="hobbies"> I am found of Formula 1. I discovered this sport a few years ago and since then I have been a huge fan. I had the amazing opportunity to see a Grand Prix in Barcelone as you can see on the pictures above. I support Lewis Hamilton, first because he is the greatest of our era and second because he is the first black pilot in Formula 1 and diversity is an important cause for me. He brings a whole new vibe in Formula 1 through his celebrity but also all his social fights. </p>  

    	<h3> - Dogs </h3>

    	<p id="center"> I am passionnate about nature, I grew up in countryside and I just need to see trees and grass and just something green where I live or I do not feel good. I constantly need to have that connection with nature. I try to go hiking at least once in a month, it is where you can see the most beautiful landscapes.</p>

    	<h2> My travels </h2>
    	<p> Thanks to my parents, I have been able to travel a bit. I really love travelling, this is one of the things that I like to do the most. I guess it comes from the fact that I do not like to see or do the same things everyday, I need 'new'. Here are some pictures of some of my travels :</p>
